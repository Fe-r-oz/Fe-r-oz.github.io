title: "QuantumCliffordJuMPExt: compute the minimum distance of QLDPC using Mixed Integer Programming"
link: "https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumClifford.jl/pull/439"
duration: "November 2024 - Present"
description: "This project implements a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach to compute the minimum distance of Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes. The implementation utilizes GNU's Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) and can be generalized to work with other independent MIP solvers. This method was initially proposed by Panteleev and Kalachev (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02703) and later extended by Bravyi et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07915). The latter reference notes that the MIP-based approach was originally developed in 2011 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.5738). This project allows the users to compute the minimum distance with ease and also provide the necessary documentation along with the relevant modern usecases."
