title: "QuantumCliffordOscarExt: Extending the capabilities of 2BGA codes via Oscar's Group Algebra"
link: "https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumClifford.jl/issues/396"
duration: "October 2024 - Present"
description: "For researchers deeply involved in researching 2BGA codes, functionalities such as designing very specific group presentations, non-abelian groups, direct products of groups are currently not supported. This is well highlighted in this aforementioned paper, where specific presentations are the key ingredient for construction of Group Algebra of 2BGA with abelian and non-abelian groups. The goal is to extend the capabilities of 2BGA codes in three verticals: 1) specific group presentations for finitely presented groups 2) Direct product of two or more general groups 3) Semidirect product of two or more general groups"
