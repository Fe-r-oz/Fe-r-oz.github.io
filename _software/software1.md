title: "Completing the non-Clifford capabilities "
link: "https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumClifford.jl/issues/309"
duration: "July 2024 - Present"
description: "QuantumClifford library already has some nascent capabilities to represent non-Clifford states as a weighted sum of tableaux states. Such a representation is useful in settings where there is a small number of non-Clifford gates in a mostly Clifford circuit. The cost is still exponential in the number of non-Clifford gates, but manageable. We have simple state representation and gate application already done, expect is nearly implemented in this PR, and project! still needs to be implemented. The aforementioned features need to be completed, well tested, and well documented."
