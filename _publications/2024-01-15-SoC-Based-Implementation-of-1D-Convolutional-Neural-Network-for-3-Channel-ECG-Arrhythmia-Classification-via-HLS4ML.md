excerpt: 'This paper presents a SoC-based implementation of a 1-D convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) for 3-channel ECG arrhythmia classification using HLS4ML. It demonstrates the benefits of quantization-aware training (QAT) and high-level synthesis (HLS) in reducing power consumption while maintaining competitive performance metrics, offering an efficient, low-latency, and cost-effective solution for real-time ECG monitoring.'
