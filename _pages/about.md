## About Me

I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Computer Engineering, from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST-NUCES), Lahore Campus, Pakistan, in June 2023.

Following my graduation, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Smart Networking Research Group at FAST-NUCES from February 2023 to September 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Saima Zafar. We achieved a novel milestone by pioneering the first application of High-Level Synthesis for Machine Learning in medical applications. Our work was published in IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (Impact Factor: 1.7). 

I chose to take gap years to further explore my academic interests—a decision that guided me toward pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. As an incoming doctoral candidate and dedicated researcher at University of Massachusetts Amherst, I am grateful to my family for their steadfast encouragement throughout this pivotal chapter of my life.

I am grateful to Prof. Stefan Krastanov of Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for his wonderful mentorship and guidance as I embark on this new journey.
